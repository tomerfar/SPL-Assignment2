Set Card Game Simulation (Java)

Focus: Concurrent processing of game logic and player actions

Description:
Implemented a Java-based simulation of the classic “Set card game”. 
The project centers on efficient handling of game mechanics, including card dealing, set validation, and score tracking, within a multithreaded environment.
The design prioritizes deadlock-free synchronization to manage game state and ensure a seamless and responsive gaming experience.

Skills Demonstrated:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Synchronization
- Multithreading
- Data Structures
- Concurrent Programming
